JavaScript Learning Repository: Chai Aur Code
Overview
<br>
This repository contains JavaScript files and exercises that I worked on while learning JavaScript through the "Chai Aur Code" series. These files demonstrate different concepts and challenges that are covered throughout the learning process.

Getting Started:-
To view or run the JavaScript files, you can clone this repository using the following command:

bash:

    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
    <br>
Make sure you have Node.js installed if you're running any of the scripts on your local machine.

Usage:-
Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
        cd <repo-name>
        Run individual JavaScript files:
    bash:
        node <filename>.js
